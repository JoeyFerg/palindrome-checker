# palindrome-checker

A simple project that allows you to see how many palindromes of length x exist.  
  
To run, you just need to input a number to indicate what length of words you want the algorithm to check for (ex. 5). 
It will use a file you provide it (currently words.txt, which is just a list of all the words in the dictionary).
